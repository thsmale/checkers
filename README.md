This is a group project from CSU Chico CSCI580 Artificial Intellgience. This group used the following division of labor. 
Troy worked on the movements of the checker pieces. 
Cameron developed edible pieces and checker pieces. 
Henry implememnted the ABP algorithm. 
Thomas developed the Graphical User Interface, ABP algorithm, and coordinated organization of the files.
